2. Data Types in Python

Python has various built-in data types. Some common ones are:

int: For integers (e.g., 1, -3, 100)
float: For floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
str: For strings (e.g., "Hello", "Python")
bool: For boolean values (True or False)

Type Checking:

You can use the type() function to check the type of a variable.'''

x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
