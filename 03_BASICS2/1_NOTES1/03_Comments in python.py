# 3. Comments in Python

# Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are used to explain the code or leave notes for yourself or others. They do not affect the execution of the program.

# Single-line comments start with #:

# This is a single-line comment

print("Hello, World!")
# Multi-line comments can be written using triple quotes (""" or '''). These are often used to write detailed explanations or temporarily block sections of code:

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
"""
print("Hello, Python!")
